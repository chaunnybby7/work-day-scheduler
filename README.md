Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Used the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. 

`localStorage` is used to store data. 
 

## Installation

1. Download or clone repository
2. Open the main page (index.html) on your browser to view
3. Use a text editor to view all coding. I'm using Visual Studio Code. 

## Functionality

- On the index.html page, user will see the current date and time. 
  
- The time slots are 9 hours range from 8AM to 5PM. 
- The tasks/to-do list text area are divided into 3 different colors: 
* Past: ![#d3d3d3](https://via.placeholder.com/15/d3d3d3/000000?text=+)  Grey
* Present: ![#ff6961](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ff6961/000000?text=+) Red
* Future: ![#77dd77](https://via.placeholder.com/15/77dd77/000000?text=+) Green

- Users can type in their tasks or notes in the colored columns and the data will be stored. 
- When users reload or open the browser again, the saved tasks/notes will be presented.
